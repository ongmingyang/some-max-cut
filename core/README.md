Some Max Cut (the python version)
--------

Runs the python version of max cut

TODO
----

1. Enhance modularity -- too many functions accessing internal rep of data
2. Strip superfluous wrappers -- clique does not need to exist?
3. Code is sometimes confused if it should be OO or functional
4. Logging takes up too much time
5. potentialTable init is too slow
